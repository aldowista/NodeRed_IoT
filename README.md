IoT Lab Project 

### About

In this lab project, we were given ESP32 DEV boards and tasked with creating a system using the MQTT protocol and a dashboard of our choice. We selected NodeRed Dashboard for its user-friendly interface to display our data. This document details our work from setting up the ESP32 boards, choosing and configuring HiveMQ Cloud as our MQTT broker, to implementing security features.
